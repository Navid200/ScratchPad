#### **What is the outcome if this happens?**  
If this happens to you, you will lose your database and all your settings.  It will be like you have just installed xDrip for the very first time on your phone.  
There will be no way to recover the old readings or your settings.  
  
#### **What should you do?**  
1- We have a daily automatic backup into Google Drive option.  [Google Drive Backup](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/GoogleDriveBackup.html)  
You can enable this so that a backup of your database and all settings will automatically be made on a daily basis.  
  
2- We have a daily automaitc database backup onto the phone local storage option.  [Daily legacy database backup](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Backup/SaveDaily.html)  
You can enable this so that a database backup is made on a dialy basis and saved on your phone.  
  
3- You can upload your readings to a repository in the cloud.  Nightscout is an option.  Tidepool can be another.  
This will allow you to have your readings aved somewhere else as well for safekeeping.
