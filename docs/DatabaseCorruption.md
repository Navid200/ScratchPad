#### **What is the outcome if this happens?**  
If this happens to you, you will lose your database and all your settings.  It will be like you have just installed xDrip for the very first time on your phone.  
There will be no way to recover the old readings or your settings.  
  
#### **What should you do?**  
1- Set up upload to the cloud.  You can use Nightsocut or Tidepool for that.  
Then, your data will be safe regardless of what happens to your xDrip database.  
Considering you could lose your phone, this would be strongly recommended even if there was no possibility of database corruption.  
  
2- We have a daily automatic backup into Google Drive option.  [Google Drive Backup](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/GoogleDriveBackup.html)  
You can enable this so that a backup of your database and all settings will automatically be made on a daily basis.  
  
3- We have a daily automatic database backup onto the phone local storage option.  [Daily legacy database backup](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Backup/SaveDaily.html)  
You can enable this so that a database backup is made on a daily basis and saved on your phone.
